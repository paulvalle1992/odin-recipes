    <h1>The only mashed potato recipe you will ever need.</h1>

    <h2>Mashed potatoes with a focus on butter.</h2>
    <p>This mashed potatoes recipe is simple but effective. It is the only recipe
        you will ever need because it is so simple and it is the foundation of mashed 
        potato recipes! Mashed potatoes are such a simple dish that is arguably the 
        main side on Thanksgiving but also a side that can be used for any good dinner meal.
        Given this why not start with a simple mashed potato recipe ? I recommend peeling
        and I also recommend putting in those extras if you are a fan of loaded potatoes,
        (however, those you will add at the end after recipe is complete!) hello bacon!! </p>
