First Odin Project
This will be my first project with Odin creating a website using html to demonstrate the skills i have attained thus far. This includes using html to: creating webpages with html, adding photos, adding links to other pages within the site itself and links to other sites within the web, creating unordered and ordered lists, and adding bold italic to important text.
